#README for MSDSHW5

Purpose:
The Homework 5 repository holds MSDS Week #5 homework assignment files for Doing Data Science Summer 2018.

Topics:
The focus of Unit 5 is on creating Tidy Data.  The homework assignment allows the student to work through an example where a text file needs to be corrected, two text files need to be merged and various information extracted from the datasets.

Sources:
Two text files, yob2015.txt and yob2016.txt were used for this exercise.  These files contain the number of firstnames used for newborns in the United States in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
